// "http://localhost:5002", CORS does not block server to server communication
// So request like postman, curl, or another server like port 5002 over here are not blocked
// Because of that I'm changing my logging method, rather than archival of the cars
// I'm going to log where the request is from and what did it do (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)

// There is another method, which is passworded / tokened requests
// I'm still going to do logging, but IF this was a real world project
// I would do tokened requests (that's more work tho :v)
