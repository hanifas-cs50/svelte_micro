// "http://localhost:5002", CORS does not block server to server communication
// So request like postman, curl, or another server like port 5002 are not blocked
// Because of that I'm changing my logging method, rather than archival of the cars
// I'm going to log where the request is from and what did the request do
// Example: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE

// There is another method, which is passworded / tokened requests
// But that's too much work for a school assignment
// So I'm still going to do logging
// buuut IF this was a real world project, I would do tokened requests
